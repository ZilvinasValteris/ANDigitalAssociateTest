ANDigital Test
========

Run:

* To run this application navigate to its folder on your file system and run *mvn tomcat7:run* command
* Hitting *ctrl + C* in the command line will stop the application and the server

Approach:

1. Choose the language to write the code in: Java; because this is the one that I know best. I could not write a proper application using JavaScript (as advised in test description)

2. Choose the framework: Spring; because this is the framework that I have used most recently and hoped it would be a bit faster/easier to get things done using it.

3. Embed Tomcat server to the project so the application can be run easily and the user does not need to worry about downloading and running Tomcat server separately
